Building on top of 3 philosophies:

- Performance
You shall not worry about the underlying performance
- Simplicity

- Flexibility
You shall be able to customize most of the library to fit your needs

Designed with TypeScript in mind, you don't need to understand TypeScript to gain the benefit of TypeScript with Elysia. The library understands what you want and automatically infers the type from your code.
