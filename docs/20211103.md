Tiny, easy and powerful React state management

What advantages does it have? ✨
  📦 ・Tiny: Less than 1kb package to manage your state in React and Preact.
  🌱 ・Easy: You don't need actions, reducers, selectors, connect, providers, etc. Everything can be done in the simplest and most comfortable way.
  🚀 ・Powerful: When a store property is updated, only its components are re-rendered. It's not re-rendering components that use other store properties.
